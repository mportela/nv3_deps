Description: pep8 - Python style guide checker
        =================================
        
        pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style
        conventions in `PEP 8`_.
        
        .. _PEP 8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        
        
        Mailing List
        ------------
        http://groups.google.com/group/pep8
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.
        
        * Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.
        
        * Small: Just one Python file, requires only stdlib. You can use just
          the pep8.py file for this purpose.
        
        * Comes with a comprehensive test suite.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install, upgrade, uninstall pep8.py with these commands::
        
          $ sudo pip install pep8
          $ sudo pip install --upgrade pep8
          $ sudo pip uninstall pep8
        
        Or if you don't have `pip`::
        
          $ sudo easy_install pep8
        
        There's also a package for Debian/Ubuntu, but it's not always the
        latest version::
        
          $ sudo apt-get install pep8
        
        Example usage and output
        ------------------------
        
        ::
        
          $ pep8 optparse.py
          optparse.py:69:11: E401 multiple imports on one line
          optparse.py:77:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
          optparse.py:88:5: E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
          optparse.py:222:34: W602 deprecated form of raising exception
          optparse.py:347:31: E211 whitespace before '('
          optparse.py:357:17: E201 whitespace after '{'
          optparse.py:472:29: E221 multiple spaces before operator
          optparse.py:544:21: W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
        
        You can also make pep8.py show the source code for each error, and
        even the relevant text from PEP 8::
        
          $ pep8 --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E111.py
          testsuite/E111.py:2:3: E111 indentation is not a multiple of four
            print x
            ^
              Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
        
              For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can
              continue to use 8-space tabs.
        
        Or you can display how often each error was found::
        
          $ pep8 --statistics -qq --filename=*.py Python-2.5/Lib
          232     E201 whitespace after '['
          599     E202 whitespace before ')'
          631     E203 whitespace before ','
          842     E211 whitespace before '('
          2531    E221 multiple spaces before operator
          4473    E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
          4006    E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
          165     E303 too many blank lines (4)
          325     E401 multiple imports on one line
          3615    E501 line too long (82 characters)
          612     W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
          1188    W602 deprecated form of raising exception
        
        Quick help is available on the command line::
        
          $ pep8 -h
          Usage: pep8.py [options] input ...

            --exclude=patterns   exclude files or directories which match these comma
                                 separated patterns (default: .svn,CVS,.bzr,.hg,.git)
            --filename=patterns  when parsing directories, only check filenames matching
                                 these comma separated patterns (default: *.py)

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.6.1 (2010-10-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed inconsistent version numbers. (Issue #21)
        
        
        0.6.0 (2010-09-19)
        ------------------
        
        * Test suite reorganized and enhanced in order to check more failures
          with fewer test files.  Read the ``run_tests`` docstring for details
          about the syntax.
        
        * Fix E225: accept ``print >>sys.stderr, "..."`` syntax.
        
        * Fix E501 for lines containing multibyte encoded characters. (Issue #7)
        
        * Fix E221, E222, E223, E224 not detected in some cases. (Issue #16)
        
        * Fix E211 to reject ``v = dic['a'] ['b']``. (Issue #17)
        
        * Exit code is always 1 if any error or warning is found. (Issue #10)
        
        * ``--ignore`` checks are now really ignored, especially in
          conjunction with ``--count``. (Issue #8)
        
        * Blank lines with spaces yield W293 instead of W291: some developers
          want to ignore this warning and indent the blank lines to paste their
          code easily in the Python interpreter.
        
        * Fix E301: do not require a blank line before an indented block. (Issue #14)
        
        * Fix E203 to accept NumPy slice notation ``a[0, :]``. (Issue #13)
        
        * Performance improvements.
        
        * Fix decoding and checking non-UTF8 files in Python 3.
        
        * Fix E225: reject ``True+False`` when running on Python 3.
        
        * Fix an exception when the line starts with an operator.
        
        * Allow a new line before closing ``)``, ``}`` or ``]``. (Issue #5)
        
        
        0.5.0 (2010-02-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed the ``--count`` switch to print to sys.stderr and set
          exit code to 1 if any error or warning is found.
        
        * E241 and E242 are removed from the standard checks. If you want to
          include these checks, use switch ``--select=E,W``. (Issue #4)
        
        * Blank line is not mandatory before the first class method or nested
          function definition, even if there's a docstring. (Issue #1)
        
        * Add the switch ``--version``.
        
        * Fix decoding errors with Python 3. (Issue #13 [1]_)
        
        * Add ``--select`` option which is mirror of ``--ignore``.
        
        * Add checks E261 and E262 for spaces before inline comments.
        
        * New check W604 warns about deprecated usage of backticks.
        
        * New check W603 warns about the deprecated operator ``<>``.
        
        * Performance improvement, due to rewriting of E225.
        
        * E225 now accepts:
        
          - no whitespace after unary operator or similar. (Issue #9 [1]_)
        
          - lambda function with argument unpacking or keyword defaults.
        
        * Reserve "2 blank lines" for module-level logical blocks. (E303)
        
        * Allow multi-line comments. (E302, issue #10 [1]_)
        
        
        0.4.2 (2009-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Decorators on classes and class methods are OK now.
        
        
        0.4 (2009-10-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Support for all versions of Python from 2.3 to 3.1.
        
        * New and greatly expanded self tests.
        
        * Added ``--count`` option to print the total number of errors and warnings.
        
        * Further improvements to the handling of comments and blank lines.
          (Issue #1 [1]_ and others changes.)
        
        * Check all py files in directory when passed a directory (Issue
          #2 [1]_). This also prevents an exception when traversing directories
          with non ``*.py`` files.
        
        * E231 should allow commas to be followed by ``)``. (Issue #3 [1]_)
        
        * Spaces are no longer required around the equals sign for keyword
          arguments or default parameter values.

        0.3.1 (2009-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixes for comments: do not count them when checking for blank lines between
          items.
        
        * Added setup.py for pypi upload and easy_installability.
        
        
        0.2 (2007-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Loads of fixes and improvements.
        
        
        0.1 (2006-10-01)
        ----------------
        
        * First release.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Should command line option --repeat be enabled by default?
        
        - Does command line option --ignore properly prevent status code 1?
        
        - Release version 1.0 after a brief stabilization period.
