Description: README for Pylint (http://www.pylint.org)
        =========================================
        
        Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
        helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in
        Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).
        
        Pylint has many rules enabled by default, way too much to silent them all on a
        minimally sized program. It's highly configurable and handle pragmas to control
        it from within your code. Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add
        your own checks.
        
        It's a free software distributed under the GNU Public Licence.
        
        Development is hosted on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/ .
        
        You can use the python-projects@logilab.org mailing list to discuss about

        Install
        -------
        
        Pylint requires the astng (the later the better) and logilab-common (version >=
        0.53) packages.
        
        *  https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astng
        * http://www.logilab.org/projects/common
        
        From the source distribution, extract the tarball and run ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        You'll have to install dependencies in a similar way. For debian and
        rpm packages, use your usual tools according to your Linux distribution.
        
        More information about installation and available distribution format
        may be found in the user manual in the *doc* subdirectory.
